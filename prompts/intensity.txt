Now assign an average intensity score for each minute of the practice.
Intensity refers to the fitness challenge of the combination of poses over the course of each minute.

Meditation is none: holding a shavasana for the entire minute should have zero intensity.
Breathwork shouldn't add intensity unless it's a significant part of the minute, like repeated box breathing (which would still only be low on its own).
Balance and stretching add similar amounts of intensity as each other; a deep stretch or very challenging hold should be high.
Strength has the biggest effect on intensity, especially if a challenging pose is held for a long time or there are rapid changes between hard poses (e.g. a full minute of multiple cycles of plank -> chaturanga -> downward dog -> chair -> plank would be maximum intensity). 

Remember that the poses are stored with the start and end times which you can use directly without converting into seconds.

Do not just use the principle scores assigned by the previous step — also consider the language used by the instructor during the minute.

Return a list of floats (0 to 1) of intensity scores in the format [0.23, 0.64...], with position 0 representing 00:00:00 --> 00:00:59 etc.
