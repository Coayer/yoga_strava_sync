Finally, create a title for a Strava activity, with a reference to the current time of {0} (without writing the exact time). It should be a lowercase informal sentence and slightly funny. 

Examples: 
"chill midweek midnight vibes 😌🌙"
"up at 8am on sunday against all odds 🌅"
"hard session but made it through 😮‍💨"

Return using the JSON format
{{
    "title": "..."
}}
